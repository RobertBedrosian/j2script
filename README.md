## The grammar:
```
var is a variable name
str is a string
i is an int

type ::= int | 
         boolean | 
         string | 
         classname // introduce wrapper classtype implements type which has a name

returntype ::= type | void

op ::= + | - | * | /

// might want to change.  Look at java grammar documentation
exp ::= i | true | false
        additive |
        new classname(exp*) |
        var.methodname(exp*) | // will need to check if void
        str |
        this
 
additive ::= multiplicative ( ('+' | '-') multiplicative)*

multiplicative ::= primary ( ('*' | '/') primary)*

primary ::= i | var 
 
vardec ::= type var

stmnt ::= exp; |
	      return exp; |
          return;
          break; |  
          println(exp); |
          { stmnt* } |
          vardec = exp; |
          var = exp; |
          if (exp) stmnt else stmnt |
          while(exp) stmnt
 
access ::= public | private

methoddef ::= access returntype methodname(vardec*) stmnt  // comma seperated vardecs

instancedec ::= access vardec;

// canâ€™t access instance variables with dot.  Need getters and setters.
classdef ::= class classname [extends classname] {
             instancedec*
             constructor(vardec*) stmt  // comma seperated vardecs
             methoddef*
             }

program ::= classdef* stmnt
```

## Features  
- Computation Abstraction Non-Trivial Feature: Class-based inheritance
                        
- Non-Trivial Feature #2: Access Modifiers
                        
- Non-Trivial Feature #3: Generic Programming
                
- Work Planned for Custom Milestone: Generics

## Type Checker
- Variables have the correct type when assigned

- Variables are defined when assigned

- Expressions evaluate to the correct type

- Variables have the correct access for the current scope

- Classes have the correct access for the current scope

- Return is called in a method

- Break is called only within a while loop or if statement

- Classes must have unique name

- Variables must have unique name

- Function calls take expected parameters of expected types
